# CheckersGame
First Project

## Functionality
This will function as a two player game of chess abiding by all the traditional rules of the game.

## Rules
Dark pieces traditionally go first.
Pieces may only move in a forward diagonal path. Until they are 'kinged'
Pieces may only occupy dark squares on the gameboard.
Each players only move one piece at a time.
A piece my jump over an opposing players piece if they are at adjacent squares on the gameboard.
Once a piece is jumped by the opposing player that piece is removed from the board.
Once a piece has reached the other side of the game board it will be 'Kinged'
Once a piece is 'Kinged' it may move in either a forward or backward direction.
A player wins when the opposing player has no more pieces remaining on the board.
