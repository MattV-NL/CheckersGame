# CheckersGame
This is my first project created with HMTL, CSS, and Javascript with the help of GetCodingNL. The goal is to be able to select your piece from the board and move it around using javascipt.

The first mission is to first be able to identify the pieces on the board I am going to print to the console when a piece is clicked on and be able to identify whether the piece is black or white. 
Once I am able to identify the pieces and get response from the console regarding where the mouse is clicked then I shall to to move a piece to another square.
Then, I will make it so a piece can only move as it is allowed by the rules of the game
Another important part of any game is to be able to switch turns of the players so that a player can only move one piece per turn.

## Functionality
This will function as a two player game of chess abiding by all the traditional rules of the game.

## Rules
- Dark pieces traditionally go first.

- Pieces may only move in a forward diagonal path. Until they are 'kinged'

- Pieces may only occupy dark squares on the gameboard.

- Each players only move one piece at a time.

- A piece my jump over an opposing players piece if they are at adjacent squares on the gameboard.

- Once a piece is jumped by the opposing player that piece is removed from the board.

- Once a piece has reached the other side of the game board it will be 'Kinged'

- Once a piece is 'Kinged' it may move in either a forward or backward direction.

- A player wins when the opposing player has no more pieces remaining on the board.
